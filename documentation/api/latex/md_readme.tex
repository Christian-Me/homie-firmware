{\bfseries{Work in progress update \#1}}

Early alpha of my own firmware for my automation projects on ESP8266 and ESP32 platform it is based on the great homie-\/esp8266 library.

It is still a work in progress but I\textquotesingle{}m happy like it is working now {\bfseries{next\+:}} design of the display api

As handy as all the great frameworks like ESPEasy, Tasmota ... sooner or later I had issues with some details. As I use the homie convention for my communication via MQTT the choices are limited too. After several single task projects I decided to start with a new approach collecting all the bits and pieces into my own modular firmware or perhaps I should call it framework?

Perhaps I\textquotesingle{}m reinventing the wheel here. But why not?

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item small footprint 400k with 3 plugins (OTA should be possible even on 1MB flash). Will be reduced by removing a lot of debugging log messages.
\item around 40k free RAM using 3 Nodes with 6 parameters (plenty of headroom for own code). Thy to use {\ttfamily PROGMEM} wherever possible and useful.
\item plugins linked on demand (only used plugins go into binary)
\item build in sample timer per property
\item threshold value to send data if a property changed
\item build in timer to send data regardless of a change
\item oversampling (rolling average to remove noise)
\item write your own code using c and not a limited scripting interpreter
\item OTA via MQTT upload thanks to the homie-\/\+ESP8266 library (you can use DHCP for your devices)
\item crash detection (to be improved) to enable OTA even when your code causes an exception resulting in a boot loop
\item logging to console and syslog. Console logging can switch log level (1..8) and extra info (i,m) by key press.

This project is intended to be compiled using \href{https://platformio.org/}{\texttt{ platform\+IO}}. I highly recommend using vs-\/code as your IDE not only because this is the official IDE for platform\+IO but it is a great tool for beginners and advanced users\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsection{create your on project}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md26}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item create your project in {\ttfamily platformio.\+ini} with a unique {\ttfamily build\+\_\+flag}
\item add your project into {\ttfamily device-\/xxx.\+h} and include it to your section in the {\ttfamily platform.\+ini} file
\item edit your {\ttfamily device-\/xxx.\+h} file. Here is where all your device specific things should happen.
\item edit your own {\ttfamily config.\+json} with your device configuration (see example)
\item upload your {\ttfamily config.\+json} via usb or flash the initial-\/upload build to use the config web interface or upload your config using curl
\item flash your firmware via usb/serial or OTA if you have flashed the initial-\/upload build
\item use the serial console or syslog for debugging

the following list shows the planned and implemented devices. Basically all devices I used before or planning to use in the near future. Think the list grows quickly. Hopefully the ticks too.
