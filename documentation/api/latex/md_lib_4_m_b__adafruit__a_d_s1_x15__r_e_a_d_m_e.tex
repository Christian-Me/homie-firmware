The chip\textquotesingle{}s fairly small so it comes on a breakout board with ferrites to keep the AVDD and AGND quiet. Interfacing is done via I2C. The address can be changed to one of four options (see the datasheet table 5) so you can have up to 4 ADS1x15\textquotesingle{}s connected on a single 2-\/wire I2C bus for 16 single ended inputs.
